# Logic & Scale: Systems Engineering Portfolio

A high-performance, minimalist portfolio designed to showcase systems engineering expertise. This site focuses on the "what happens inside the memory" philosophy, featuring interactive visualizations of concurrency, distributed systems, and low-level architectural patterns.

## 🚀 Live Environment
**URL:** [archishman.dev](https://archishman.dev) (or your Vercel deployment)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (Fluid-physics interactions)
- **Visuals**: Lucide React, Custom SVG/CSS Systems DNA Visuals
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Production-optimized)

## 🧬 Engineering Pillars
- **Distributed Systems**: Focus on P2P networking, eventual consistency, and fault tolerance (Merkle Trees, Gossip Protocols).
- **Concurrency**: Deep integration with Go's concurrency model (Goroutines, Channels, Throughput optimization).
- **Low-Level Architecture**: Optimized for performance—thinking about L1 caches, zero-allocation paths, and memory safety.

## 📦 Project Trajectory
- **[001] DeStore**: Decentralized storage platform inspired by IPFS and Go concurrency.
- **[002] AeroSense IoT**: Real-time air quality monitoring with Node.js and custom hardware integrations.
- **[003] DSA System**: Performance-aware practice suite for memory-efficient algorithms.
- **[004] Adiyogi Weather SDK**: Multi-language SDK and FastAPI-based weather aggregation system.

## 💻 Local Development

1. **Clone & Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArchishmanS2005/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (if used for generative features) in native `.env.local`.

3. **In-Flight**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
